DSL - Domain Specific Language
Excel to Tally derives it logic from Column names. We have more than 15 worksheet templates and growing. Every one  of them follow consistent naming convention and behaves in the same way. How? 
Xml DSL - It is like Tally TDL. It has abstracted actions into some plain English wods like Dr, Cr TYPE, DEFAULT Group and Ledger, user specified Ledger names in ALIAS  columns etc.  We know which columns are Ledger names and so create ledgers automatically if they do not exist.  It is stored in XmlStr_GST.xml.  It has one Xml for each one of Worksheets. Sales and MySales worksheets store Sales data but differently but the Voucher Type is Sales. our columns can be left blank, shuffled and even deleted. Only if minimum data is not given Tally rejects the data. ID column is used to combine multiple rows into a single voucher. We have user defined columns also.
